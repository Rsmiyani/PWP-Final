# For Python 3.13 users:
# Option 1: Install PyAudio from unofficial binaries
#   Download from: https://github.com/intxcc/pyaudio_portaudio/releases
#   Then: pip install PyAudio-0.2.14-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl
#
# Option 2: Use alternative - install without PyAudio and use system default mic
#   The code will still work but may have reduced audio quality
